This repository is a sports management application that allows admins, players, and users to create and manage sports sessions. Here are the features and functionalities of the application:

Admin Functionality
Admins have the following capabilities:


Admins can create sports.
Signed-in admins can view a list of sports they have created and create a new sport.
When creating a sport, admins can provide a name for the sport.
Admins can create and join sport sessions, just like regular players.
Admins have access to reports showing the number of sessions played in a configurable time period.

Player Functionality
Players have the following capabilities:


Players can sign up and sign in.
If players don't have an account, they can sign up by providing their name, email address, and a password.
Existing players can sign in using their email and password.
Players can sign out if they choose to do so.
Signed-in players can create a new sport session.
When creating a session (a match), players can select one of the available sports, enter the names of already available players in each team, and specify the number of additional players they are looking for. They can also specify the date, time, and venue for the session.
Players can view details of existing sessions created by other players and join a session.
Once a player joins a session, their name is marked against a slot and made visible to other users.
Sessions that a player has joined are displayed separately from available sessions.
Players who have created a session can cancel it by providing a reason.
